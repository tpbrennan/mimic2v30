Reason: eval for cord/ligament injury 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old woman with known C1 & C2 fx 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cord/ligament injury 
INDICATION: 17-year-old unrestrained back seat passenger in a 
motor vehicle accident with known C1 and C2 fracture. Assess for 
spinal cord/ligamentous injury.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the 
cervical spine without IV contrast.

Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine performed seven 
hours earlier.

FINDINGS: The images are slightly limited in quality due to 
motion artifact. Again seen is the transverse fracture through 
the dens, better appreciated on the prior CT scan.

Increased T2 and STIR signal intensity is seen in the spinal 
cord extending from the level of the tip of the dens to the 
superior endplate of the C4 vertebral body. There is mild 
expansion of the cord at the level of the body of C2. Axial 
gradient echo images demonstrate susceptibility artifact 
centrally in the cord at the level of C2.

At the C2-3 and C3-4 levels, there is mild left paracentral disc 
bulging with mild narrowing of the left neural foramina at these 
levels. There is no central canal stenosis. Vertebral body and

Service:  GYNECOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 51-year-old G0 who
presented with postmenopausal bleeding, starting after 12
months of amenorrhea.  A pelvic ultrasound on [**7-18**] of
[**3076**] at Valley Medical Group showed two echogenic structures
in the lower uterine segment suggesting polyps, normal
ovaries, endometrial stripe was 4.5 mm.  An endometrial
biopsy on [**3077-7-19**] was inactive endometrium and a pap
smear was within normal limits.  A hysteroscopy dilatation
and curettage on [**9-10**] showed an atypical polypoid
adenomyoma.  Patient elected for definitive treatment.
Although there are few cases reported, this is probably a
precancerous lesion, so a total abdominal hysterectomy
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was warranted.  Patient was
consented.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  In [**3032**] she had a tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy.  Hysteroscopy dilatation and curettage
[**3077-9-10**].  She had knee surgery in [**3037**], [**3038**] and
[**3074**].

MEDICAL CONDITION:  She has had shingles and mild
hypothyroidism.  She is a G0.

GYNECOLOGY HISTORY:  Menstrual history:  Started at age 10,
every 21 days times seven days, very heavy.  Her last
menstrual period was [**3075-10-18**].

ALLERGIES:  Codeine gives her a rash.  She is allergic to
Demerol which gives her a rash.  She is allergic to nuts with
anaphylaxis.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had lung cancer and breast cancer.
Father had a history of ventricular fibrillation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a criminal law professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10227**]
Northeast and she does not live alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  Weight 160.  Blood
pressure 160/80.  Chest with clear breaths.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender with no CVA tenderness.  Pelvic
exam:  Normal external female genitalia.  Vagina had normal

tenderness.  Uterus was retroverted, normal size and
nontender.  Adnexa:  Nontender, no masses were noted.
Cul-de-sac had no lesions.  Rectal was guaiac negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient underwent a total abdominal
hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of
adhesions on [**3077-10-1**].  For details of the procedure,
see separate dictation.  Patient's postoperative course was
complicated by pain control issues.  Patient was started on a
Dilaudid PCA postoperatively and was discontinued from her
PCA on postoperative day one, but still complained of pain
that was not controlled on po Dilaudid.  Patient's pain
slightly subsided with two doses of intravenous Toradol 15 mg
each.  Patient's pain was under better control by
postoperative day two with po Motrin 400 mg q. 4 given with
po Dilaudid 4 mg q. 4 as well.

Infectious Disease:  On postoperative day two, patient was
diagnosed with a wound cellulitis and was started on Keflex
500 mg po q.i.d. for seven days.  On postoperative day two,
patient's wound was noted to have erythema approximately 3-4
cm superior to the incision and 2 cm below the incision.
There was noted induration of approximately 2 cm lateral to
the incision on the left hand side, but was nontender and did
not have any evidence of drainage.  On postoperative day
three, after patient was started on Keflex, the wound
erythema had decreased and induration had decreased as well.

100% on room air.  In general, he is an ill appearing white
male.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen
soft, flat, nontender.  Back:  Indurated fluctuant right
flank with foul-smelling purulent drainage.  Positive
erythema.  Rectal is heme positive brown stool.

LABORATORY:  His sodium was 126, potassium 4.8, 88, 29, 18,
1.4 and 90.  His white blood cell count was 10.5, hematocrit
32, platelets 480.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2528-2-6**], and
the patient had his back abscess drained.  After CT scan
showed distal small bowel leak to the well drained
retroperitoneal abscess, it was clear that the patient had an
enterocutaneous fistula.  The patient was started on total
parenteral nutrition through a right IJ line for nutrition
preoperatively.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl intravenously.  Duplex ultrasound was obtained for his
right lower extremity swelling, which was negative.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2528-2-11**],
for resection of enterocutaneous fistula and ileostomy and
incision and drainage of the flank wound.  Postoperatively,
the patient was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Kefzol.
Immediately postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for septic shock.  The patient's blood
pressure had dipped into the 80's systolic.  The patient was
also febrile.  The patient was given intravenous fluids and
was started on pressure support of Levophed.  The patient
stayed three days in the Intensive Care Unit, was weaned off
the Levophed and was transferred to the Floor.

The patient was continued on his Levofloxacin and Flagyl and
was continued on total parenteral nutrition.   The patient's
diet was advanced on [**2528-2-15**] with a regular diet and Boost
supplements.  On [**2528-2-16**], on postoperative day number
five, the patient's PCA was discontinued.  The patient was
started on Percocet and breakthrough morphine for pain.  The
patient was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy
as well.

On [**2528-2-17**], it was noted that the patient's ostomy output
was increased to 4500 cc.  At that time, the patient was
started on motility slowing [**Doctor Last Name 355**] Lomotil.  The patient was
hyponatremic and this was supplemented with cc per cc normal
saline replacements from his ostomy as well as in his TPN.
Part of this problem was the high ostomy output.  A GI
consultation was obtained because of this high output and the
patient was started on Questran per their recommendations, 4
grams p.o. twice a day.  The patient was also started on
Octreotide 100 micrograms per hour intravenous q. eight
hours.

On [**2528-2-20**], postoperative day number nine, it was noted
that the patient's ileostomy drainage had decreased slightly.

CHEST: The heart, hilar, and mediastinal contours are 
unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural 
effusions. The left lung is grossly clear. The right lung has an 
area of haziness in the mid to upper lung zone, which likely 
represents a contusion given this patient's history of trauma. 
The surrounding osseous structure show a right clavicular 
fracture and rib fractures anteriorly in ribs 3 through 8, many 
of which are displaced. There is a small amount of subcutaneous 
emphysema overlying the right hemithorax, but again no discrete 
pneumothorax or hemothorax is identified. IMPRESSION: No 
evidence for pneumothorax. Multiple fractures as described 
above. Opacity developing in the right mid to upper lung zone, 
which likely represents contusion given the history of trauma.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  [**3159-8-13**] 1:59 AM
RIGHT FOOT, 3 VIEWS: There are comminuted fractures involving 
the medial aspects of the proximal and distal phalanges of the 
first digit. Additionally, there is a small fracture fragment 
along the lateral aspect of the distal first metatarsal, likely 
representing a fracture fragment. There is a subtle linear 
lucency coursing through the proximal shaft of the first 
metatarsal representing a non-displaced fracture. No other 
definite fractures are identified. The remaining joint spaces of 
the foot are normal. IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures within the 
right foot as described above.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right toe laceration and right knee
laceration.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right toe laceration and right knee
