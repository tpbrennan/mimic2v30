ADDENDUM:  Since the previous dictation, the patient has had
a video swallowing study which showed accumulation of bullous
in the vallecula.  The study was not continued for fear of
further accumulation in the vallecula, which could lead to
frank aspiration.  It was recommended that the patient be
kept on nothing by mouth and continue on tube feeds.  Speech
and swallow evaluation recommends that the patient have a
repeat video swallowing study in approximately one month.

The patient also had bilateral lower extremity venous
Dopplers.  There was concern at [**Hospital1 **] that the patient had
persistent hypoxia which may have been thought to persistent
pulmonary emboli.  There was no evidence of deep vein
thrombosis on bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies.

The patient had her Foley catheter changed and a repeat urine
showed 140 white blood cells and many yeast.  The patient was
started on Diflucan 200 mg orally/per G-tube times the first
day and then 100 mg daily times four days.

If there are any other changes to the [**Hospital **] hospital
course, another addendum will be added.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Difficulty breathing, tracheal stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with complicated medical
history within the past year, transferred from [**Hospital3 3683**] to have treatment for tracheal stenosis.  The
patient has had difficulty breathing since Friday due to
increased secretions and weakness.  Patient had bronchoscopy
on day of admission by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] which showed mild
tracheal stenosis.  The patient is transferred to [**Hospital1 47**] for bronch, possible stent, possible
balloon dilation of the tracheal stenosis.

The patient has had a prolonged hospital course since [**2766-7-20**] when she was admitted to [**Hospital1 10289**] Hospital for
a 9 cm thoracic aneurysm repair and coronary artery bypass
graft of left anterior descending artery (50% lesion),
complicated by bleeding requiring reop.  Postop course
complicated by afib managed with Lopressor and amio.  The
patient was slow to wean off vent and on [**2766-8-11**] had a
trache and PEG placed.  Hospital course was also complicated
by congestive heart failure and a cerebrovascular accident
which presented with right sided weakness with negative CT
scan.

Tracheostomy complicated by necrosis at site with positive
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus swab culture.
Sputum and Gram stain at [**Hospital1 10289**] Hospital was positive
for Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for slow vent wean.

No DC sent from [**Hospital1 **] was available, however, patient's
family states that she was taken off the vent around
[**Holiday 6258**] time.  Her hospital course was complicated by
multiple pneumonias and increased secretions.  The patient
complained of difficulty breathing in [**Hospital1 **] and had a
bronch on the morning of admission which showed mild tracheal
stenosis.  The patient states the breathing has improved
since Friday before admission after aggressive suctioning.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Thoracic aneurysm repair in [**2766-7-21**] with coronary artery
bypass graft times one to left anterior descending artery
complicated by bleeding requiring repeat surgery.
2. Cerebrovascular accident.
3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR treated with amiodarone.  The
patient is currently in sinus.
4. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.
5. Status post trach.
6. Status post PEG.
7. Status post left fem endarterectomy with patch graft and
left posterolateral thoracoplasty with Hemashield graft.
8. Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of greater than
55%, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid
regurgitation with left ventricular hypertrophy at [**Hospital1 10290**] Hospital at 08/01.
9. Hypertension.
10. Arthritis.
11. Hyperthyroidism treated with PTU.
12. Claustrophobia.

Service:

Pneumonia diagnosed at outside hospital.  During this
hospitalization we did a chest x-ray which showed probable
right upper lobe pneumonia, apical pleural thickening versus
loculated pleural effusion.  Patient was continued on
Levaquin 500 mg via G tube q day and Flagyl 500 mg q eight
hours and Vancomycin 1 gram IV q day.

We did not continue the Bactrim during this hospitalization.
It is unclear whether the patient is colonized with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or whether she
has sputum positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus causing a pneumonia.  Sputum cultures were ordered,
but were not able to be sent because the patient was in the
operating room all day.

4. GI:  G tube, possible aspiration pneumonia.  We continued
the tube feeds and lactobacillus, Colace, and Protonix during
this hospitalization.  The patient will also have a video
swallowing study to be done this am to rule out aspiration
pneumonia.  An addendum will be added to this dictation with
the results of the video swallowing test.

5. Genitourinary:  The patient had an indwelling Foley
catheter.  A urinalysis was positive for 288 white blood
cells and many yeasts.  The Foley was changed during this
admission and we will recheck a repeat urinalysis.  Patient
has not been started on treatment for yeast cystitis as of
yet.

6. Endocrine:  The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism
and was on PTU which was continued during this admission.  A
TSH was checked which was 6.7 and T4 was checked which was
0.8.  It is unclear to us at this time whether the patient
needs to be continued on PTU.

7. Neurologic:  The patient is status post cerebrovascular
accident and had remained stable neurologically during this
admission.

The patient had a left PICC line placed at outside hospital
which is maintained during this admission.

In terms of nutrition, the patient was continued on her tube
feeds and required more free water boluses at 500 cc q eight
hours.  It appears that her sodium is 146, which most likely
indicates free water losses.  The patient's electrolytes were
repleted.  We will continue to observe.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Mild tracheal stenosis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:
Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient will return to [**Hospital3 1096**] today.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Captopril 87.5 mg via G tube q eight hours, Atrovent
metered-dose inhaler, albuterol metered-dose inhaler, free
water boluses, 250 cc per G tube q six hours, Vancomycin 1
gram IV q day, Tylenol 650 mg po q 4-6 hours prn,
albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers q four hours prn, Protonix 40
mg via G tube q day, amiodarone 200 mg per G tube q day,
Dulcolax 10 mg per G tube q day, multivitamin per G tube q

Service:  MICU-[**Location (un) **]

This note picks up with her transfer from the [**Hospital1 **]
Internal Medicine Service to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
[**Location (un) **] Service following her asystolic cardiac arrest. The
following note will summarize her hospital course until that
point.  A subsequent summary will describe the rest of her
hospital course.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit following asystolic cardiac
arrest.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 81-year-old woman with a
complicated medical history including thoracic aortic
aneurysm repair with a coronary artery bypass graft times one
in [**2766-7-20**].  She also has had CVAs, history of
tracheostomy complicated by tracheal stenosis, and she was
transferred from [**Hospital3 1096**] on [**11-29**] for
treatment of tracheal stenosis at [**Hospital6 2138**].

The patient has a complicated recent medical course dating
back to [**2766-7-20**] when she was admitted to the [**Hospital6 2095**] for repair of a 9 cm thoracic aneurysm
and coronary artery bypass graft times one of the left
anterior descending.  Postoperative course was complicated by
bleeding requiring reoperation, atrial fibrillation, started
on Lopressor and amiodarone.  Congestive heart failure felt
secondary to diastolic dysfunction.  CVA with residual
right-sided weakness.  She was slow to wean from the
ventilator and on [**2766-8-11**], had a tracheostomy placed
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed.  Tracheostomy
was further complicated by necrosis at the placement site,
question of timing, and nosocomial pneumonia.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] in [**2766-7-20**] for a slow
wean.  According to the family, she was on the ventilator for
12 weeks and was taken off around [**Holiday 6258**] time.  Her
hospital course was complicated by recurrent episodes of
pneumonia with copious secretions and intermittent atrial
fibrillation.  Bronchoscopy was done on [**11-29**], when she
was noted to have mild tracheal stenosis and she was
transferred to [**Hospital6 656**].  She was
placed on vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl for a presumed
nosocomial aspiration pneumonia.  Bactrim was discontinued.
Initially saturating at 96% on five liters.  She had no
evidence of cardiac ischemia and was in sinus rhythm on
admission.

SUMMARY OF HER HOSPITAL EVENTS:

On [**11-30**], the patient was hypotensive to 80/palp after
receiving captopril, responded to fluid bolus, underwent
rigid flexible bronchoscopy with mild tracheal stenosis and
dilation up to 18 mm.  Aspiration by swallow study was on the
13th.  Started on fluconazole for oral candidiasis, fungal
urinary tract infection.

From [**12-2**] through the 16th, she had mild shortness of
breath, afebrile, good oxygen saturation in the high 90s on
one to three liters of oxygen, systolic blood pressure 90-100
with scant sputum.  On [**12-5**] she had right upper
extremity swelling ultrasound showed right IJ and subclavian
vein thrombosis.  She had a right PICC.  Vancomycin, Levaquin
and Flagyl were discontinued following completion of a 14 day
course on [**12-5**].  She had a right upper lobe
consolidation improving, new bibasilar opacities, left
greater than right.  On the 19th, acute shortness of breath
and had been suctioned for a large amount of secretion,
desaturated to 91% on room air.  Electrocardiogram showed
worsening T wave inversions in the anterior leads, in I, aVL
and V4 through V6.  Chest x-ray showed increased perihilar
haziness consistent with congestive heart failure and small
bilateral effusions.  She received Lasix again.

On [**12-8**], she was noted to have acute hypoxia, question
of mucus plug, suctioned with improvement.  She had MRV to
evaluate the extent of her right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis whether or not it was originating from the PICC.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old woman
with a complicated medical history including thoracic
aneurysm repair and single vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2766-7-20**], CVA, history of tracheostomy
complicated by tracheal stenosis, who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 1096**] on [**11-29**] for treatment of tracheal
stenosis at [**Hospital6 656**].  The
patient has a complicated recent medical course dating back
to [**Month (only) **] of this year when she was admitted to the [**Hospital6 2095**] for repair of a 9 cm thoracic aneurysm
and single vessel coronary artery bypass graft of her left
anterior descending.  Her postoperative course was
complicated by bleeding requiring reoperation, atrial
fibrillation for which she was started on Lopressor and
amiodarone.  Congestive heart failure felt secondary to
diastolic dysfunction and CVA with a residual right-sided
weakness.  She was slow to wean from the ventilator at that
time and on [**8-11**] of [**2765**] had a tracheostomy and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed.  Tracheostomy was
further complicated by necrosis at the placement site and a
nosocomial pneumonia.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital3 3683**] in [**Month (only) 328**] of this year secondary to a slow wean.

According to the family, she was on the ventilator for
approximately 12 weeks and taken off around [**Holiday 6258**]
time.  Her hospital course was complicated by recurrent
episodes of pneumonia with copious secretions and
intermittent atrial fibrillation.  Bronchoscopy was performed
on [**11-29**] when she was noted to have mild tracheal
stenosis and she was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2138**].  She was placed on vancomycin, Levaquin and
Flagyl for a presumed nosocomial aspiration pneumonia.
Initially, her oxygen saturation was 96% on five liters.  She
had no evidence of cardiac ischemia and was in sinus rhythm
on admission.  When admitted to [**Hospital6 3127**], she was found on [**11-30**] to be hypertensive to
pressure 80/palp after receiving captopril.  This responded
well to a fluid bolus.  She underwent a rigid and flexible
bronchoscopy and was found to have mild tracheal stenosis.
She was dilated to 18 mm.  On the 13th, she was noted to have
aspiration by swallow study.  She was also started on
fluconazole for oral candidiasis and a fungal urinary tract
infection.

On the 14th to the 16th, she was noted to have mild shortness
of breath, was afebrile, and was maintaining oxygen
saturations in the high 90s on one to three liters of oxygen
with good blood pressure control.  Her sputum was scant.  On
the 17th, she was noted to have right upper extremity
swelling.  An ultrasound showed a right internal jugular and
subclavian vein thrombosis.  She had a right-sided PICC line.
Her vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl were stopped following
completion of a 14 day course.  Chest x-ray on the 17th
showed resolution of her right upper lobe consolidation, but
with new bibasilar opacities, more so on the left than on the
right.

On the 19th, she was noted to have acute shortness of breath
and was suctioned for a large amount of secretions.  Her
oxygen saturation dropped to 91% on room air and an
electrocardiogram done at the time showed worsening of T wave
inversions in the anterior and lateral leads (I, aVL and V4
through V6).  Chest x-ray done at the time also showed
increased perihilar haziness consistent with congestive heart
failure and small bilateral effusions.  Patient was treated
with Lasix.

On the 20th, she was noted to have acute hypoxia and had a
questionable mucus plus that was suctioned with improvement.
A magnetic resonance venogram was performed to evaluate the
extent of her right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis that
was seen by ultrasound earlier.  Following the MRV, the
patient was noted to be diaphoretic and clammy with depressed
mental status.  On he...,,
